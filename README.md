# READNE

This will be a new version of the book written by Didier Besset.
But I will try to adapt this to Ruby and Raku as there exists an Pharo implementation 
here:

https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/PolyMath-book

I will try to do my best while learning Ruby, Raku and Latex, so any error will be my fault.

We thank him for his gift to the community.

The original version of this is book is fully latexing and available at
https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/ArchiveOONumericalMethod/

## With the original README:

This archive contains the book of Didier Besset in its original form. 

The `OONumericalMethodsAsGiven` folder contains the original files.

The `NumericalMethods` folder contains a version fixed to rebuild the book using a modern LaTeX toolchain.

Based on it we prepared a new version without the Java code but it is hosted in another repository.
